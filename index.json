My research broadly focuses on leveraging these mobility modes to improve transportation system efficiency while reducing social inequality and environmental impacts. I utilize data science techniques, economics, and optimization to investigate the mechanisms that promote sustainable transportation.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate at the Univeristy of Michigan, School for Environment \u0026amp; Sustainbility and Department of Civil \u0026amp; Environmental Engineering.
