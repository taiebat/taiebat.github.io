Shared mobility, wireless charging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration, and vehicle automation have complementary features that rectify the practical barriers and implementation restrictions of each other. We attempt to bridge between transportation research studies and the environmental sustainability community, discuss the recent findings, and identify critical knowledge gaps to better understand the synergies and mutual benefits of these emerging technologies and avoid unintended environmental consequences.","tags":[],"title":"Synergies of Four Emerging Technologies for Accelerated Adoption of Electric Vehicles: Shared Mobility, Wireless Charging, Vehicle-to-Grid, and Vehicle Automation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaihui Song","Shen Qu","Morteza Taiebat","Sai Liang \u0026 Ming Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568151081,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568151081,"objectID":"df8d43a928de605595009b341ff4774e","permalink":"/publication/201909-hh-consumption-enviromentinternational/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T16:31:21-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/201909-hh-consumption-enviromentinternational/","section":"publication","summary":"The U.S. household consumption, a key engine for the global economy, has significant carbon footprints across the world. Understanding how the U.S. household consumption on specific goods or services drives global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important to guide consumption-side strategies for climate mitigation. Here we examined global GHG emissions driven by the U.S. household consumption from 1995 to 2014 using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model and detailed U.S. consumer expenditure survey data. The results show that the annual carbon footprint of the U.S. households ranged from 17.7 to 20.6 tCO2eq/capita with an expanding proportion occurring overseas. Housing and transportation contributed 53–66% of the domestic carbon footprint. Overseas carbon footprint shows an overall increasing trajectory, from 16.4% of the total carbon footprint in 1995 to the peak of 20.4% in 2006. These findings provide valuable insights on the scale, distribution, and variations of the global GHG emissions driven by the U.S. household consumption for developing consumption-side strategies in the U.S. for climate mitigation.","tags":[],"title":"Scale, Distribution and Variations of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Driven by U.S. Households","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shidong Zhang","Morteza Taiebat","Yu Liu","Shen Qu","Sai Liang \u0026 Ming Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565474691,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565474691,"objectID":"4582efc9f039c3341d1c07096839d3a3","permalink":"/publication/201908-virtual-water-cleanerproduction/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T17:04:51-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/201908-virtual-water-cleanerproduction/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Regional water footprints and interregional virtual water transfers in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Morteza Taiebat","Samuel Stolper \u0026 Ming Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564696211,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564696211,"objectID":"05da3353c06cbfab89bf3d99fe6a49db","permalink":"/publication/201908-cav-rebound-appliedenergy/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T16:50:11-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/201908-cav-rebound-appliedenergy/","section":"publication","summary":"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to yield significant improvements in safety, energy efficiency, and time utilization. However, their net effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy reduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel cost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy “rebound effect.” Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel, inducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast the induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel behavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) choice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate elasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost data from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and wage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the combined price elasticity of VMT demand is −0.4, which differs substantially from previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have more elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more sensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities to simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a range of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a 2–47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate that backfire – i.e., a net rise in energy use – is a possibility, especially in higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for reductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and global air pollution, as CAV use increases.","tags":[],"title":"Forecasting the Impact of Connected and Automated Vehicles on Energy Use: A Microeconomic Study of Induced Travel and Energy Rebound","type":"publication"}]
